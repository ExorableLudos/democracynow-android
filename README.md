# democracynow-android
This program parses the Democracy Now (Democracy Now!(.)org) rss and links to the videos
It uses the SimplisticRss library by ShirwaM

There is an android app on the play store that plays Democracy Now feed. 
It is more comprehensive than this one -- but it's closed source.
I was trying to copy it. There are ads, so thats why I wrote this. 

TODO:
Add images to the List adapter
Add podcast function
Play video in APP GALLERY and not browser (like the other app does)
