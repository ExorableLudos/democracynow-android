Democracy Droid

#Disclaimer
I have no affiliation with Democracy Now! (They won't even return my emails).

## Democracy Droid
This program parses the [Democracy Now!](http://democracynow.org) RSS-feed and it links to the video broadcasts. The application 
sends the intent to open the video in either the Gallery viewer (or something of its kind), VLC (recommended), or the Browser. If you don't 
feel like compiling from the source, look in the build folder for an app-release.apk and install Democracy Droid on your phone.

Find v.1.1 on the Play Store
