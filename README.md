## Free Democracy Now! for Android
This program parses the <a href="http://democracynow.org">Democracy Now!</a> RSS-feed and it links to the video broadcasts. The application sends the intent to open the video in either the Gallery viewer (or something of its kind), VLC (recommended), or the Browser. It uses the SimplisticRss library by <a href="https://github.com/ShirwaM/Simplistic-RSS">ShirwaM</a>
